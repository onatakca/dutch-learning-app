However these are helpful for anyone attempting to learn a second language from a book or a website. Of course the children have it right: the ''best'' way to learn a language is to listen to a mother tongue speaker and simply repeat. Then just use the word in a similar situation and see how people react. Children are masters at acquiring language this way and are generally smiled at when they use a word incorrectly. Being an adult, people are often not so forgiving to you and you feel foolish when people laugh and point out to you that you just said \"toothbrush\"  while you meant \"toothpick\". Besides, native speakers may not always be available to you. Or if they are they are not eager to spend time playing 'child' with you. This book will try to compensate this by addition of audio files and visual information, -as the figure to the right- but that is still only a cumbersome substitute. We do recommend that you use them as much as you can. Firefox seems to give easier access to them than other browsers. So, please go ahead, push that arrow and learn to say 'toothbrush' properly. Your first Dutch word? Congrats."

This course therefore uses both approaches: it will deal with grammar, but it will also ask you to be a child and listen and repeat or look at some pictures while playing a sound clip. Don't be afraid to be a bit childish! It serves a purpose."

Children are champions in language acquisition and they never worry about what they do. Oh, and what you do, may very well be doing that same exercise again. Children love doing things \"again\". Ever watched the Teletubbies? ''Repeating'' is an important key to language acquisition. Being \"efficient\" and saying: \"oh, I have done that before, let me skip that!\" is a bad adult habit that children would never stoop to, until they get really bored with something. (Which is when they already know it). So, push that button below the toothbrush again! And tomorrow come back here and do the same."

It is e.g. comparable with   in G\u00e0idhlig,  in German,   in French,  in Spanish,  in Russian, or  in Japanese. When to use one or the other is not always easy to decide. Someone unknown, particularly if older, is generally ''u'', an old friend typically ''je, jou''. The latter roughly corresponds with the 'first name basis' in English.

''Gij'' is mostly used when speaking dialect, although it gets used more and more in polite situations and on tv. In the north it has become obsolete since about 1800. It is used much like ''you'' in English for both singular and plural. In the North ''gij'' is now only encountered there in archaic phrases like: ''gij zult niet stelen'' - ''thou shalt not steal''. Like ''thou'' the pronoun ''gij'' takes its own verb forms. This course is mostly based on northern usage as this is the most widely accepted, including in Suriname and the Antilles, but some important differences will be pointed out and we will see ''gij'' occasionally when we look at some older poetry."

Strictly speaking it would be correct for Northerners to call a clock a \"he\", but they often avoid that as well.For three centuries they have been chided and ridiculed by grammarians, school teachers and Southerners for not knowing whether a noun is masculine or feminine. Grammarians and school teachers have finally given up on that since 1947, but now insist that ''hij'' should be used for ''de klok''. Northerners have a long history of ignoring them and will stick to avoiding both hij and zij. Nowadays ''hij'' and ''zij'' are pretty much restricted to people or their pets, so they indicate ''natural'' rather than ''grammatical'' gender, certainly in the North. Notice that Northerners cannot resort to ''het'' (it) as done in English, because ''de klok'' is '''not''' neuter..."
